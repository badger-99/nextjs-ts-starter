This [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) template is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and has the following features.
 - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety.
 - [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
 - [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack), a bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript and built into Next.js for faster local development.
 - Is compatible with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
 - Has [`next-themes`](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/dark-mode/next) installed with `system` being the default along with `dark` and `light` mode options.
 - Uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.
 - A screen size indicator visible only during development. 
 

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org) or later installed on your system:

Install  `pnpm`

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```
Finally, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
